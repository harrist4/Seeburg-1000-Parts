# Seeburg-1000-Parts

The Seeburg '1000' Background Music System is a mechanical marvel of the late 1950s that used an intriguing purely mechanical mechanism to play custom 16-2/3 RPM records on both sides and then restack them once they have all been played through.
Each record holds 40 minutes of music per side, with approximately 20 tracks per side. The machines originally supported playing 25 records; hence, 25 records of 40 tracks each gives us the '1000' in the name.

This project is intended to store technical drawings that can be used for making parts to repair or improve Seeburg 1000 machines.
